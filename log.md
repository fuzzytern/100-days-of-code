# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today:** Implemented a basic version of dynamic arrays in C99, using structs and variable length arrays.
**Thoughts:** My code was refactored quite a few times. It's been a while I haven't written C but it somehow feels good...

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

**Today:** Implemented a basic version of linked lists in C, using structs.
**Thoughts:** Feels like a good start, will add more functions another day.
