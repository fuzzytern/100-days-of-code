# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: January 12th, 2017

- **Today:** Further work on the link list in C. Code now produces expected results. 
- **Thoughts:** Could I use mcpy to avoid the double pointer? Need more digging to fully understand it.
- **Link to work:** [My code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/linkedList.c)

### Day 9: January 11th, 2017

- **Today:** Worked on the blog: played with vue-router and prerendering
- **Thoughts:** About to get vue-router operational. Then need to make it play with prerendering nicely.
- **Link to work:** [My code](https://github.com/niwolive/blog)

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

- **Today:** Got the linked list to compile but it's railsing some runtime exceptions.
- **Thoughts:** This is stretching my mind with double pointers, memcpy etc... Will need to clear it up.
- **Link to work:** [My code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/linkedList.c)

### Day 7: January 9th, 2017

- **Today:** Setup basic StandardML development environment + wrote first function.
- **Thoughts:** It's fun, the feel is good. Liking type checking and functional style.
- **Link to work:** [My code](https://twitter.com/niwolive/status/818489209438736384)

### Day 6: January 8th, 2017

- **Today:** Improved my basic version of dynamic array in C. Added remove method, ˋfreeˋ call and some refactoring.
- **Thoughts:** Should be operational now. Will check once I have access to a compiler.
- **Link to work:** [Dynamic Array code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/dynArray.c)

### Day 5: January 7th, 2017

- **Today:** Wrote a simple binary search implementation in C
- **Thoughts:** Written on phone, will need to compile.
- **Link to work:** [Link to the code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/simpleBinarySearch.c)

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

- **Today:** Fixed my binary search tree deletion and type the thing on Github.
- **Thoughts:** Should be good to go. Spotted a few syntax errors I made in my previous C code too, regarding to semicolons.
- **Link to work:** [Link to the code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/binarySearchTree.c)

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

- **Today:** Got started on binary search trees in C on paper.
- **Thoughts:** List in deletion, will need to fix and type it online tomorrow.
- **Link to work:** [Picture of my draft](https://twitter.com/niwonow/status/816891114154233856?s=09)

### Day 2: January 4th, 2017

- **Today:** Implemented a basic version of linked lists in C, using structs.
- **Thoughts:** Feels like a good start, will add more functions another day.
- **Link to work:** [Linked list code](https://github.com/fuzzytern/cs-study/blob/master/linkedList.c)

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

- **Today:** Implemented a basic version of dynamic arrays in C99, using structs and variable length arrays.
- **Thoughts:** My code was refactored quite a few times. It's been a while I haven't written C but it somehow feels good...
